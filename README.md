_Documenting how I set up my windows machine._

After one too many OS updates locking up my machine, I've decided to invest some time and effort in automating getting it back as I like it from a clean install. The goal is everything being installed via a script, and where that's not possible writing down the installers needed to run.

## Annoying things
- Remap [CAPS to CTRL](https://gist.github.com/joshschmelzle/5e88dabc71014d7427ff01bca3fed33d) - requires reboot (not just a restart)

## MacOS

My Mac set up is a bit simpler, and all done via brew:

```
brew install python3 stgit
brew install --cask firefox vscodium bitwig-studio spotify whatsapp google-drive
```

With oh-my-zsh installed manually & the capslock remapped to control.
